AXML Parser and AXML Printer
Original code from : https://github.com/claudxiao/AndTools

Added support for both UTF8 & UTF16 as Parsing UTF8 with original parser was failing.

--- Introduction ---

AXML Parser is used to parse the binary XML format used by Android devices (which is called AXML format). It's writen by ANSI C language. It provides a pull parse interface to user, and provides a simple function(AxmlToXml) to convert AXML format into XML format.

AXML Printer is an example of how to use AXML Parser, and is also an useful tools to transform AXML files into plain XML format.
